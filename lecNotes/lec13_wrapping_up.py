"""
Abstractions
    choosing the right abstractions

Automated execution
    Think in terms of mechanising our abstractions

Algorithms
    language for describing automation process


COMPUTATIONAL THINKING

How difficult is this problem and how can I best approach it
complexity
Thinking recursively


WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN

1 - Learned PYTHON to express computation
2 - Learned about the process of writing and debugging a program - be SYSTEMATIC
3 - Learned to estimate COMPLEXITY
4 - Learned about the process of moving from a problem statement to a computational
    formulation of a method for solving the problem
    USE ABSTRACTION
5 - Learned a basic set of recipes - ALGORITHMS


WHY PYTHON

Easy to learn and use
    Simple syntax
    Interpretive - makes debugging easier
    Don't have to worry about managing memory (garbage collection)

Modern
    Supports currently stylish programming and OOP

Increasingly Popular
    Used in an increasing number of subjects
    increasingly used in industry
    large and growing set of libraries


Write psuedo code first
    - helps you to abstract and work through problem in head first


WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?
    When given a problem how would you write a piece of code

    CS 6.002x - optimization modelling
    Algorithms and data structures
    Intro to machine learning
    Software engineering
    Computer acrhitecture
